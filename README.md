## Brainstorming Ideas
  - Vertical Screen
  - Dragon static in center, flying upwards (background moving down, dragon bobbing)
  - No split on screen, reference in menu
  - Human has support spells - all with pp, buttons, not patterns
- Distance boost
- Slowing time
- Healing
- Strengthen attacks
- push enemies away
  - Infinite flying, but able to progress farther with better attacks/ leveled up attacks
  - Prestiging with egg? to start over
  - Flying vertically into space
  - Dragon action and caretaking game - Only action for now
  - Action is figting, attack above, left, right, or around with fire, wings, tail, or biting
  - Each type of attack has strengths/weakness against particular enemies
  - Enemy encyclopedia?
  - Stats boosted based on levels/experience
  - Fictional, made up enemies attacking from top, left and right, health scales with height
  - Kamekaze attacks, die on contact
  - In game currency - treasure that can be broken along with killing enemies - added for caretaking later
  - Unlocking achievements - later
  - Patterns are broken up by type: jaw, wing, tail, fire
  - All have directional and around, around is weaker
  - Can level up each attack to make stronger
  - Patterns have pattern part and direction like: ----O, O----, and vertical
  - Possibly longer range strong attacks that are more difficult to draw, need to find balance so game isn't broken
  - Customize your character? Unlock playable characters? Unlock different dragons? Eggs? Have multiple dragons with different abilities?
  - Do just fighting screen first, then add caring/customization
  - Sprints/Goals/Tasks:
- Make something show up on screen
- Make an animation
- Make attacks
- Make pattern recognition
- Make enemies
- Make attacks kill enemies
- Make more sophisticated attacks/patterns
- Make more enemies
- Make scoring system
